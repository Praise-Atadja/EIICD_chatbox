Some individuals may have delayed speech development, difficulty with conversation, or rely on alternative communication methods like gestures or picture communication systems.'\n",

            " 'Repetitive behaviors in autism can include repetitive movements (stimming), insistence on sameness or routines, fixated interests, and unusual sensory behaviors. These behaviors may serve to self-regulate, reduce anxiety, or provide sensory stimulation.'\n",
            " 'Stimming (self-stimulatory behavior) includes repetitive movements or actions such as hand-flapping, rocking, or spinning objects. Individuals with autism may stim to regulate sensory input, manage stress or anxiety, or as a way of expressing excitement or frustration.'\n",

            " 'Autism may affect language development by delaying speech onset, impairing the ability to understand and use language effectively, or leading to atypical language patterns such as echolalia (repeating words or phrases). Speech therapy and alternative communication methods can help improve communication skills.'\n",

Techniques such as mindfulness and sensory-based strategies can aid in emotional regulation.'\n",
            " 'Autism severity is often categorized into three levels based on the level of support needed: Level 1 (requiring support), Level 2 (requiring substantial support), and Level 3 (requiring very substantial support). These levels reflect the degree of impairment in social communication, behavior, and adaptive functioning.'\n",

These therapies are tailored to address specific challenges and promote skill development.'\n",
